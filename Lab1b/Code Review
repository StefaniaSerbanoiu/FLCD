Review of minilanguage


Overview
The language specified in EBNF seems to serve its purpose and be able to support multiple operations.
The grammar has a good readability and is written in a way easy to understand.

Lexic
The lexic contains arithmetic, relational and assignment operators and a wide range of separators.
There seem to be 3 simple data types, char, string and int, and a user defined type, an array.

Syntax
There are multiple types of statements defined: declaration, assignment, conditional(if), while, and i/o.
The expression, condition and relation are also well-defined.
The language also supports compound statements.

Task requirements
The requirements of the task seem to be respected(the language contains 2 simple data types and a user-defined type,statements,
assignment, input/output, conditional, loop).
The language has a correctly defined syntax and lexic.

Possible improvements
For a more complete language, more arithmetic operations or simple/user-defined types could be added.
